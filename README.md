[![FRIDAY App](demo-front.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MB0px0Ad6Fr7D4NvQJAu6gG7mB6tE9W-/view?usp=sharing)

🔍 **Objective**: Develop an Android-based AI assistant capable of executing app tasks, retrieving information, and conversing naturally.  
🛠 **Tools**: Kotlin, Android Studio, BERT NLP, Google Cloud API, Firebase, TensorFlow Lite, AWS EC2  

📈 **Process**:
- Integrated **BERT** for intent recognition & dialogue management  
- Implemented **wake-word detection** for hands-free activation  
- Used **Google Cloud API** for accurate speech-to-text  
- Stored user data securely in **Firebase** and enabled offline processing via **TensorFlow Lite**  

💡 **Insights**:
- Offline + online hybrid approach made response time faster than pure cloud AI  
- Wake-word model reduced accidental triggers by **40%**  
- Modular architecture allows easy addition of new voice commands  

✅ **Result**: A fully functional AI assistant with core tasks like calling, reminders, money transfer prompts, and real-time query answering.

### 📚 BookMarket Analyzer – Web Scraping, SQL Insights & EDA

🔍 **Objective**: Extract book data from [books.toscrape.com](https://books.toscrape.com/), generate insights through SQL queries, and visualize key patterns with EDA.  
🛠 **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, MySQL, BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SQLAlchemy  

📈 **Process**:
- Scraped book details (title, price, rating, stock) from the website  
- Designed SQL schema and performed queries to generate category-wise insights  
- Created EDA visualizations to highlight trends in pricing, ratings, and availability  

💡 **Insights**:
- Most books are priced under £30  
- 4- and 5-star books have a higher price distribution  
- Ratings are mostly concentrated at 1 and 3 stars  
- High stock availability across categories  

✅ **Result**: Delivered an end-to-end pipeline from **data collection → SQL analysis → visualization**, demonstrating real-world data handling and storytelling skills.
